## Proposal

### Title
**Smart Industrial - Manufacturing (more specifically)**

### Executive Summary

> **Please include the brief description of project, literature reviews, objectives, methodology and expected outcomes from the project**

### Detailed Project Proposal

> 1. **Project background including problem statement**

The Smart Factory is a concept for expressing the end goal of digitization in manufacturing.

The way the term is most commonly used, a Smart Factory is a highly digitized shop floor that continuously collects and shares data through connected machines, devices, and production systems. The data can then be used by self-optimizing devices or across the organization to proactively address issues, improve manufacturing processes and respond to new demands.

Various technologies such as AI, Big Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, and Industrial IoT (Internet of Things) have made smart manufacturing practices fully comprehensive.

By connecting the physical and digital world, smart factories can monitor the entire production process, from manufacturing tools and the supply chain to individual operators on the shop floor.

When fully realized, Smart factories use fully integrated, collaborative manufacturing systems to make operations flexible, adaptable, and optimizable.
